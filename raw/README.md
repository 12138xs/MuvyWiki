# Raw Sources

`raw/` stores source artifacts. Treat existing artifacts as append-only.

- Put original files in `raw/originals/`.
- Put derived Markdown or text in `raw/converted/`.
- Record every raw or converted artifact in `raw/source-manifest.jsonl`.
- Do not overwrite a raw artifact unless the user explicitly asks for it.

Each manifest line is JSON:

```json
{"source_id":"example-source","raw_path":"raw/originals/example.pdf","content_hash":"sha256:...","source_url":null,"collected_at":"YYYY-MM-DD","published_at":null,"converted_from":null,"converted_path":null,"converter":null,"converter_version":null}
```
